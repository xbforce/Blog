[Account Takeover via iFrame Injection](https://github.com/xbforce/Blog/blob/main/writeup/account-takeover-via-iframe-injection.md) Sometimes you find an XSS vulnerability on a target domain but you cannot inject your javascript codes because the target sanitizes payloads perfectly using black/white lists or stop them from doing their malicious jobs by using WAFs, but there are always different ways to bypass defending mechanisms, and it is only the matter of time and efforts. :man_technologist: [Read more](https://github.com/xbforce/Blog/blob/main/writeup/account-takeover-via-iframe-injection.md)

Stderr or standard error is another output stream typically used by programs to output error messages. :man_technologist: [Read more](https://github.com/xbforce/blog/blob/main/article/ways-of-saving-outputs.md)
